# Progressive Web App

This is a Progressive Web App which is:

* having responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
* fast & reliable, using a service worker to precache the app resources
  (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run, and cache the weather data
  at runtime to improve performance.
* installable, using a web app manifest and the `beforeinstallprompt` event
  to notify the user it's installable.
